## Shelly master switch

[Shelly](https://www.shelly.cloud) doesn't seem to have a possibility to set the device state (power on/off) without Shelly scripts overriding that setting. This API is an attempt to solve that by providing Shelly scripts with a parameter determining if the script should be executed normally or kept in off state.
